# Args:
# 	$1: The exit message (print to stderr)
# 	$2: The exit code (default is 1)
# if env var _PRINT_HELP is set to 'yes', the usage is print to stderr (prior to $1)
# Example:
# 	test -f "$_arg_infile" || _PRINT_HELP=yes die "Can't continue, have to supply file as an argument, got '$_arg_infile'" 4
